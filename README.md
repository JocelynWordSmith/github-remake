github-remake
=============

recreating my github

this was a partial reconstruction of my github profile view. I practiced using AJAX requests and working with github's
API to populate the page with dynamic, live data. All of the information from the profile images to the repository
instances and followers are being polled from github's database, so the information is identical to my actual github page.
